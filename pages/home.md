  principles:
    - We gain a deep understanding of the founder’s vision.
    - We don’t invest in product. We invest in people we admire and back their
      mission 100%.
    - '"We take an owner’s approach: we roll up our sleeves and share in the
      responsibility of building an impactful company.'
    - We act with the highest integrity, with total empathy for founders, LPs,
      and partners.
